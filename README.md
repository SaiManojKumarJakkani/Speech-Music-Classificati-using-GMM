# Speech-Music-Classificati-using-GMM
This is a classification model for Speech vs music. Used fourier transform to get the spectraogram features for all the samples. Also tuned various hyper parameters (Number of Gaussians and the type of covariance matrix) and analysed the impact on the performance for different number of mixture components, diagonal versus full covariance
